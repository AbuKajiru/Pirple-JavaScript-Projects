# Pirple JavaScript Projects
Hi everyone, this project is licensed under the MIT License.
In short, it's pretty much as open source as it gets.

I have had a lot of interest in JavaScript for the past one and a half years, but I never got a chance to test my skills and knowledge.
Through Pirple.com I am able to replenish the knowledge I have and also gauge my knowledge by the tests that they provide.

The listed files within this project, consists of the various tests that I have done so far as well as detailed "read me" files describing what each test is all about.

I hope you all enjoy.
